"Add the flour, paprika, 3/2 teaspoons salt and 3/2 teaspoons pepper to a large shallow bowl, and toss to combine. Dredge the strips of meat in the flour mixture, shake them to remove excess flour, then transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet.",
"Place a large skillet over high heat, and swirl in the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, sauté the beef slices, in two batches, until they are well browned on both sides but rate inside, 3-4 minutes. Transfer the seared meat to the baking sheet. Turn the heat down slightly.",
"Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the pan. When it has melted and started to foam, add the mushrooms, toss to coat them with the fat and season with salt and pepper.

"When the mushrooms and shallots are soft and caramelized, deglaze the pan with the wine, scraping at all the stuck-on bits on the pan's surface. When the wine has reduced by about half, slowly stir in the cream, followed by the Worcestershire and mustard. Add the meat, along with any accumulated juices, and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the dish is hot and the beef is medium-rare, 2-3 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings.",
"Serve the noodles under or alongside the stroganoff; sprinkle stroganoff with parsley."

steps: [
"Pop the joint on each leg: Grasp a drumstick in one hand and a thigh in the other, and bend the joint back until you hear a crack. (This helps the leg cook more evenly)","Using a small knife, make a slash in the meaty part of each drumstick and thigh 2-3 times, going all the way to the bone.",
"In a large bowl, stir together garlic, ginger, vinegar, cayenne, garam masala and salt. Keep half the mixture in the bowl and set aside; rub remaining mixture all over chicken, getting underneath the skin. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes (or up to 2 hours) while you prepare the yogurt marinade.",
"Stir yogurt into the large bowl with ginger-garlic mixture, then stir in black pepper, clove, mace, anise, black cardamom (if using) and green cardamom. Transfer spice-rubbed chicken to yogurt mixture, tossing gently to coat.",
"Cover and refrigerate chicken for at least 6 hours (preferably overnight).","When ready to cook, prepare the grill for indirect hear. For charcoal grills: Mound coals to one side, allowing for an area of indirect hear. For gas grills: Turn on only a few of the burners and leave the rest off. For ovens: Heat oven to 450 degrees.",
"Using a mortar and pestle, the flat side of a knife or a spice grinder for a very brief time, crack the cumin, coriander and red-pepper flakes but do not grind; you want a coarse texture here. Sprinkle spice mix onto chicken to coat each piece.",
"Place a rimmed baking sheet on the unlit side of the grill or in the oven and let heat for 15 minutes. Carefully place chicken on the hot baking sheet and drizzle each piece with a little melted butter. Cover grill, if grilling. Let chicken cook for 25-35 minutes, drizzling with melted butter two or three times. The chicken is done when the skin is dark brown and the juices run clear when pricked with a knife.",
"(Optional) If you are grilling, you can sear the chicken over direct hear for 1-2 minutes per side just before serving to char the skin.",
"Serve chicken on a platter, with lime wedges on the side."
